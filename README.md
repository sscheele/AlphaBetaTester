# AlphaBetaTester
A C# 'interactive' implementation of the AlphaBeta pruning algorithm.

AlphaBetaTester is a simple C# program that demonstrates a functional (to the best of my knowledge) AlphaBeta pruning algorithm. A great deal of the code was copied and pasted from a Chess program I'm writing to ensure the algorithm worked. To verify the algorithm, you can use an AlphaBeta tree (such as this one, from Wikipedia: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/AB_pruning.svg) and put in the required inputs. AlphaBeta goes from the leftmost node to the right, depth-first.
